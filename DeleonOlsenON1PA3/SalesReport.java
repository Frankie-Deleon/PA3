/* PROGRAM PURPOSE:
 * By: Frankie Deleon
 * The SalesSystem program generate sales reports for Tandem Enterprises.
 * It prompts the user to enter the sales system and, if the input is 'Y', calls methods to process
 * a sales report, write the sales report data to a file, and check the input file. The program uses
 * methods processSalesReport where A new SalesReport object is created, and its setProjectedSales() method
 * is called to set the projected sales. The setNoSalesReps() method is then called to set the number of
 * sales representatives, and the reports array is initialized with the size variable.
 * A for loop is used to iterate through each sales representative, set their sales data for each
 * quarter and month, and calculate their annual sales. The getSalesRepRevReport() and getRepTargetMsg()
 * methods are called to retrieve the sales representative's revenue report and their target message,
 * respectively. The revenue report and target message are added to the aSalesReport variable,
 * and the variable is added to the salesReports ArrayList. Finally, the for loop prints each report
 * using System.out.printf(), and the getCompanyTargetMsg() method is called to retrieve the company's
 * target message.The writeSalesRepData method writes the sales report data to a file. It prompts the user to enter a filename,
 * opens the file in a PrintWriter, then uses a for-loop to retrieve the sales data from the SalesReport array
 * and format it into a string with specific format specifiers. It then writes this string to the file using the
 * PrintWriter object. If an IOException is thrown, it sets fileError to true and prints an error message.
 * If no file error is present, the method closes the PrintWriter object and prints a success message stating
 * the data has been written to the file. The checkInputFile method  checks for the existence of a file, reads its
 * contents, and prints them out. It uses a try-catch block to handle potential exceptions
 * such as file not found or null pointer exceptions when trying to access or read a record.
